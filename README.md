# Flexible Framework

Flexible Framework is an ever-growing collection of useful and customizable SASS (breakpoints, grids, spacing, etc). It is the standardization of repeated patterns in our application development work at Phillip Gore Design.

## Quick Start

To get started, download the zip or clone the repo. Documentation and details can be found at [Phillip Gore Design: Flexible Framework](https://www.phillipgoredesign.com/flexible-framework/flexible-framework "Phillip Gore Design"). That's the best place to start.
